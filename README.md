# Final Project

## World Happiness and Unemployment Report

**What it does:**
This application looks at levels of happiness in the world and evaluates how that is impacted by unemployment rates and perhaps other contributors.

**Writer's Notes:**
We initially assumed that high unemployment rates would largely affect how happy a country is. However, upon further tinkering with the data, we found that economic stability isn't the only thing that contributes to people's happiness.

We then explored other contributors to happiness around the world to properly evaluate the question "What really makes people happy?"

Each tab has default value shown to showcase the visualizations. It is important that you explore more of the different options and other countries to properly have your questions answered.
